  OPPO Guangdong mobile communication limited announced today that the company successfully implemented the world's first 5G video calling demonstration using 3D structured light technology.
The demonstration is carried out at the OPPO Research Institute. The technical demonstration system uses a customized OPPO R11s smart phone with integrated structured light cameras. Through the RGB of the mobile phone and the structured light camera, the color and depth of 3D are collected and then transmitted through 5G, and the final real-time display is in the remote display.
According to OPPO, the basic principle of structured light in 3D is that structured light is collected by camera after projecting specific light information to the surface of the object. According to the change of light signals caused by objects, we can calculate the position and depth of objects, and then restore the whole three-dimensional space with high resolution and high accuracy.
Compared with traditional facial recognition, OPPO 3D technology can be applied to many scenarios such as security payment, 3D reconstruction, AR, game and so on. Among them, the most important application is face recognition, which has higher accuracy and can perform payment level operation instead of fingerprint payment.
Chen Yan, director of the center for software research at OPPO Research Institute, said that OPPO can achieve a millionth of recognition accuracy on 3D face payment, and the dimension of face recognition has reached 2048 dimensions.
This is because compared with the traditional single and double perturbation system, 3D structure light can achieve high accurate depth information collection, fast scanning, reliable dark light performance, simplified depth calculation complexity, and can achieve unique functions like 3D image modeling.
White sword, director of the OPPO Research Center's hardware research center, reveals that the 3D structure optical technology will be implemented in mobile products in 6 months, bringing the latest breakthrough technology to consumers directly.
"3D biometric technology has been fully mature, even under dark light, with a prototype cell phone with OPPO 3D structure optical technology, face recognition and unlock can be realized at a moment (100 milliseconds). This technology will break the situation that apple iPhone X has exclusive 3D face recognition and unlock function, and achieve this kind of Technology Application on Android.
5G has the characteristics of high speed (enhanced mobile broadband, eMBB), large capacity (large scale machine communication, mMTC), low delay (high reliability and low delay communication, URLLC), which will open the new era of mobile communication development. The low latency real-time transmission of 3D video in 5G network will be the key to the next generation of mobile user experience.
